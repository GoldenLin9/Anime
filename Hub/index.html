                        <p>
                            Beginning of my Junior year, I had to face the daunting standardized test as we know as, the SAT. Due to my inefficiency to read as fast as others, I lacked the pace in timing for the English section, resulting in an appalling 550 English score on my first practice test. In order to remedy this issue, I began training everyday by watching anime. Instead of reading word by word, I felt as if I was reading lines by lines. Eventually, I landed a whopping 660 in my reading section, and not to mention a 790 on the math section (1450 SAT score). During this period of time, I came to appreciate this masterpiece, which I once thought was a childish cartoon for kids. The humour, quality in art, and entertainment has a lot to offer. This website is dedicated to the wonderful things I have experienced while watching Anime.
